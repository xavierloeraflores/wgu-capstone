## Data Summary

• Provide the source of the raw data, how the data was collected, or how it was simulated.
• Describe how data was processed and managed throughout the application development life
cycle: design, development, maintenance, or others.

## Machine Learning

For each employed method (at least one is required) provide the following:
• Identify the method and what it does (the “what”).
• Describe how the method was developed (the “how”).
• Justify the selection and development of the method (the “why”).

## Validation

Once you have downloaded the entire repository, you will see the following directories:
- backend
- frontend
- data
- database
- model
- project_management
- docs

You can run the backend, frontend, database, model, and data modules locally by following the instructions in the README.md file in each of the directories. The only modules needed to run the application are the backend, database, and frontend modules. The other modules are used for data processing, model training, project management, and documentation. Once you have the database, backend, and frontend modules running, you should be able to access the site locally by navigating to the localhost address provided by the frontend module.
