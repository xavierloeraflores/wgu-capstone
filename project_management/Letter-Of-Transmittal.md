Dear Miguel Long Taplin,

I am writing to you today to propose a potential solution to a problem plaguing The Social Club L.L.C.'s platform. The Social Club platform is currently experiencing a high volume of user traffic and in particular, there has been a significant increase in the amount of user-generated content especially content that goes against the platform's moderation policies. This has led to an increase in the amount of moderation request tickets to be processed by the moderation team resulting in a backlog of tickets and a decrease in the quality of moderation on the platform.

Sincerely,
Xavier Loera Flores
