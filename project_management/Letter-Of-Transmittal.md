Dear Miguel Long Taplin,

I am writing to you today to propose a potential solution to a problem plaguing The Social Club L.L.C.'s platform. The Social Club platform is currently experiencing a high volume of user traffic and in particular, there has been a significant increase in the amount of user-generated content especially content that goes against the platform's moderation policies. This has led to an increase in the amount of moderation request tickets to be processed by the moderation team resulting in a backlog of tickets and a decrease in the quality of moderation on the platform.

To address this issue, I propose implementing a machine learning-based content moderation system that can automatically detect and flag inappropriate content. The machine learning model will be trained on large datasets of data that have been labeled for racist or explicit content. Using supervised learning and natural language processing techniques, the model will be able to learn patterns in the data and make predictions on new data to flag content that is likely to be inappropriate. The main objective of the model would be to moderate new posts as users submit them, providing immediate feedback to the user about the visibility of their post. This would help reduce the amount of inappropriate content that is visible on the platform and improve the overall user experience. The model will be implemented using logistic regression and will be trained on labeled and flagged post data. This will all done in accordance with the platform's moderation policies as well as any data privacy policies and regulations that may apply. Users would also have the ability to opt out of any data collection for training purposes.

The machine learning based content moderation system would be beneficial to The Social Club platform in several ways. Firstly, it would help reduce the workload of the moderation team by automatically flagging inappropriate content, allowing the moderation team to focus on reviewing flagged content that has been appealed by the poster. Secondly, it would help improve the quality of moderation on the platform by providing consistent and accurate moderation decisions. Finally, it would help improve the user experience on the platform by providing immediate information about the visibility of their posts.

My team and I all have several years of experience in deploying end to end machine learning solutions within the company. Our team plans on adhering to a waterfall project management methodology to develop and implement the system with an estimated timeline of 3 months for development. Our team consists primarily of fullstack engineers as well as dedicated machine learning learning engineers resulting in a cost of about $350k-$180k for development assuming we meet a 3 month timeline. Once we are complete with the project, the company will then maintain the system with an IT team resulting in an ongoing cost of about $10k-$15k per month for maintenance. We are well equipped to handle the task at hand and are confident that we can deliver a high-quality solution that meets the needs of The Social Club L.L.C. We are excited about the opportunity to implement the solution as outlined and look forward to discussing this proposal further.

Sincerely,
