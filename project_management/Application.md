## Machine Learning Algorithm & Vectorizer

The machine learning algorithm used in this project is the Logistic Regression and the vectorizer method used in this project is the using TF-IDF(Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) both of which have implementations in the SciKit-Learn library.

## User Interface

The user interface is built using the NextJS framework which is a ReactJS framework. The user interface is designed to be simple and responsive to work on all devices. The following are screenshots of key components of the user interface.
