# Project Proposal Plan

The project proposal should target your client’s middle management. This audience may be IT
professionals but have limited computer science expertise. Use appropriate industry jargon and sufficient
technical details to describe the proposed project and its application. Remember, you’re establishing the
technical context for your project manager and how it will be implemented for the client. Write everything in
the future tense.

## Project Summary

• Describe the problem.
• Summarize the client and their needs as related to the problem.
• Provide descriptions of all deliverables. For example, the finished application and a user guide.
• Provide a summary justifying how the application will benefit the client.

## Data Summary

• Provide the source of the raw data, how the data will be collected, or how it will be simulated.
• Describe how data will be processed and managed throughout the application development life
cycle: design, development, maintenance, or others.
• Justify why the data meets the needs of the project. If relevant, describe how data anomalies, e.g.,
outliers, incomplete data, etc., will be handled.
• Address any ethical or legal concerns regarding the data. If there are no concerns, explain why.

## Implementation

• Describe an industry-standard methodology to be used.
• An outline of the project’s implementation plan. This outline can focus on the project’s
development as a whole; or it may focus on only the implementation of the machine learning
solution.

## Timeline

• Provide a projected timeline, including projected start dates and end dates for each milestone (a
table is not required but encouraged).
Milestone or
deliverable

## Duration

(hours or days) Projected start date Anticipated end date

## Evaluation Plan

• Describe the verification method(s) to be used at each stage of development.
• Describe the validation method to be used upon completion of the project.

## Resources and Costs

The following section represents the proposed estimated budget for the project including a cost breakdown for development and maintenance. Labor costs are separated into the categories of engineering labor, project management labor, and maintenance labor. A consolidated hardware and resources cost is also included as well as the ongoing estimated cost for cloud usage. A full breakdown of the labor cost is provided in this budget proposal.

Development Cost Overview Breakdown:
| Resource                        | Cost                 |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Engineering Labor               | $100K-150K           |
| Project Management Labor        | $20K-30K             |
| Database Storage                | $5,000               |
| Data Processing Compute Usage   | $5,000               |
| ML Model Training Compute Usage | $20,000              |
| Upfront Cost Total              | ~$150K-200K          |

Ongoing Cost Breakdown:
| Resource                        | Cost                 |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Cloud Server Usage              | ~$35K-45K Monthly    |
| Maintenance Engineering Labor   | $10K-15K Monthly     |
| On-Going Total                  | ~$45K-60k Monthly    |


The following labor cost full breakdown estimates are based on the salaries of the individual respective roles. The real cost is calculated based on a 3-month development timeline.
