# Project Proposal Plan

The project proposal should target your client’s middle management. This audience may be IT
professionals but have limited computer science expertise. Use appropriate industry jargon and sufficient
technical details to describe the proposed project and its application. Remember, you’re establishing the
technical context for your project manager and how it will be implemented for the client. Write everything in
the future tense.

## Project Summary

• Describe the problem.
• Summarize the client and their needs as related to the problem.
• Provide descriptions of all deliverables. For example, the finished application and a user guide.
• Provide a summary justifying how the application will benefit the client.

## Data Summary

• Provide the source of the raw data, how the data will be collected, or how it will be simulated.
• Describe how data will be processed and managed throughout the application development life
cycle: design, development, maintenance, or others.
• Justify why the data meets the needs of the project. If relevant, describe how data anomalies, e.g.,
outliers, incomplete data, etc., will be handled.
• Address any ethical or legal concerns regarding the data. If there are no concerns, explain why.

## Implementation

• Describe an industry-standard methodology to be used.
• An outline of the project’s implementation plan. This outline can focus on the project’s
development as a whole; or it may focus on only the implementation of the machine learning
solution.

## Timeline

The project timeline forecast the development process for each milestone step along with the deliverables for each of the milestones. The project timeline is as follows:

Sprint Timeline Overview:
|Sprint| Dates | Task |
|------|-------|------|
| 1 | 04/01/2024 - 04/08/2024 | Project Planning |

| 3 | 04/22/2024 - 05/06/2024 | Data Preparation |
| 4 | 05/06/2024 - 05/27/2024 | Model Training |
| 5 | 05/27/2024 - 06/10/2024 | Integration & Testing |
| 6 | 06/10/2024 - 06/17/2024 | Evaluation |
| 7 | 06/17/2024 - 07/01/2024 | Model Deployment |

The project timeline is broken down into 7 milestones with each lasting 1-3 weeks. Each milestone sprint is broken down into the following tasks and deliverables:

Sprint 1: Project Planning ( 1 Week )

- Define the project scope and goals
- Clearly define the project budget
- Identify and confirm the project team
- Establish the project timeline and assign tasks

Sprint 2: Data Collection ( 2 Weeks )

- Identify validate the training data sources
- Plan the data collection method 
- Write code scripts to collect the data
- Store the data in a database for preparation

Sprint 3: Data Preparation and Processing ( 2 Weeks )

- Format the data using the appropriate standardized data structures
- Clean the data to remove any irrelevant information, duplicates, or errors
- Anonymize the data and mitigate data anomalies
- Validate the data and prepare it for training

Sprint 4: Model Training ( 3 Weeks )

- Set up the machine learning environment
- Identify and clarify vectorization technique and machine learning algorithm
- Split and vectorize the data
- Develop and train the machine learning model
- Debug and optimize the model
- Validate the vectorizer and model and save them for integration

Sprint 5: Integration & Testing ( 2 Weeks )

- Integrate the vectorizer and model with the platform
- Write tests for the model and the backend service
- Test the model and the service
- Implement end-to-end testing
- Create a maintenance plan for the IT team

Sprint 6: Evaluation ( 1 Week )

- Prepare the model for deployment and create feature flags
- A/B test the model with a small subset of users
- Monitor the system and collect feedback
- Evaluate the solution and document the results

Sprint 7: Model Deployment ( 2 Weeks )

- Deploy the model to the entire platform
- Monitor the system and collect feedback
- Document the system and write post-implementation reports

## Duration

(hours or days) Projected start date Anticipated end date

## Evaluation Plan

• Describe the verification method(s) to be used at each stage of development.
• Describe the validation method to be used upon completion of the project.

## Resources and Costs

The following section represents the proposed estimated budget for the project including a cost breakdown for development and maintenance. Labor costs are separated into the categories of engineering labor, project management labor, and maintenance labor. A consolidated hardware and resources cost is also included as well as the ongoing estimated cost for cloud usage. A full breakdown of the labor cost is provided in this budget proposal.

Development Cost Overview Breakdown:
| Resource                        | Cost                 |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Engineering Labor               | $100K-150K           |
| Project Management Labor        | $20K-30K             |
| Database Storage                | $5,000               |
| Data Processing Compute Usage   | $5,000               |
| ML Model Training Compute Usage | $20,000              |
| Upfront Cost Total              | ~$150K-200K          |

Ongoing Cost Breakdown:
| Resource                        | Cost                 |
