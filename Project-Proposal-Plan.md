# Project Proposal Plan

The project proposal should target your client’s middle management. This audience may be IT
professionals but have limited computer science expertise. Use appropriate industry jargon and sufficient
technical details to describe the proposed project and its application. Remember, you’re establishing the
technical context for your project manager and how it will be implemented for the client. Write everything in
the future tense.

## Project Summary

• Describe the problem.
• Summarize the client and their needs as related to the problem.
• Provide descriptions of all deliverables. For example, the finished application and a user guide.
• Provide a summary justifying how the application will benefit the client.

## Data Summary

• Provide the source of the raw data, how the data will be collected, or how it will be simulated.
• Describe how data will be processed and managed throughout the application development life
cycle: design, development, maintenance, or others.
• Justify why the data meets the needs of the project. If relevant, describe how data anomalies, e.g.,
outliers, incomplete data, etc., will be handled.
• Address any ethical or legal concerns regarding the data. If there are no concerns, explain why.

## Implementation

• Describe an industry-standard methodology to be used.
• An outline of the project’s implementation plan. This outline can focus on the project’s
development as a whole; or it may focus on only the implementation of the machine learning
solution.

## Timeline

• Provide a projected timeline, including projected start dates and end dates for each milestone (a
table is not required but encouraged).

## Evaluation Plan

• Describe the verification method(s) to be used at each stage of development.
• Describe the validation method to be used upon completion of the project.

## Resources and Costs

• Itemize hardware and software costs.
• Itemize estimated labor time and costs.
• Itemize estimated environment costs of the application, e.g., deployment, hosting, maintenance,
etc.
